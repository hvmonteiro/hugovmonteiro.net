## Beyond Technology
  
Beyond technology, Hugo is deeply curious about life and society as a whole. He has a strong drive to understand how and why things work, always trying to go beyond the surface and explore subjects from the inside out.  
This curiosity naturally extends to virtually every area of society — engineering, social dynamics, economics, finance, investing, business, history, politics, science, art, music, and, in general, any domain shaped by human thought and behavior.
  
  
## The Musician  
  
Music has always been a constant in his life. From having classical training in his early years in a renown music academy, to learning electric guitar on his own in his teens, which eventually led to him joining a band with a record contract and a booking agency, recording music albums and touring across Portugal and Europe.
  
  
## An Avid Writer  
  
_Hugo is also an avid writer._
  
Writing is both his voice and his tool: a way to express ideas, question assumptions, and invite others to look at familiar topics from a different perspective. Through writing, he organizes and “cleans” his mind of opinions and thought processes, while simultaneously challenging established norms and encouraging deeper reflection rather than passive acceptance.
