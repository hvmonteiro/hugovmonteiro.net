## Who?
_Hugo Monteiro_ is deeply curious about life and society as a whole. He has a strong drive to understand how and why things work, always trying to go beyond the surface and explore subjects from the inside out.  

## Professional Career

*Hugo*, being a technologist at heart with a strong business oriented profile, is currently a senior **IT Solution Designer** and **Systems Architect**, member of a R&D systems architecture team, with over **_25 years of experience_** delivering impactful **IT and R&D solutions** across some of the world’s largest technology corporations.

## Beyond Technology

Beyond technology, *Hugo*'s curiosity naturally extends to virtually every area of society — engineering, social dynamics, economics, finance, investing, business, history, politics, science, art, music, and, in general, any domain shaped by human thought and behavior.

## The Musician

Music has always been a constant in *Hugo*'s life. From receiving a classical music education in his early years at a renowned national music academy, to teaching himself electric guitar during his teenage years, his musical path eventually led him to join a band that secured a multi-album record deal along with representation by a leading booking agency, recording albums and touring across Portugal and Europe.

_This unusual hobby further strengthened his skills in organization, planning and management._

## D.I.Y. - Do It Yourself

Since *Hugo* has a strong drive to understand how and why things work and explore things from the inside out, this led him to learn how things are done, which means that very rarely he needs to hire someone to do most common things other people need - be it plumbing, painting, woodwork (ex: closets, music racks...),  fixing broken things (ex: dishwashers, furnaces, small appliances...), interior room decorations (indoor ceilings, home offices...), he even gave a hand helping build two family houses at a certain point in time...this means that sometimes friends and family ask him for help to fix things.

## Mechanics & Motorcycles

 Mechanics, the pinnacle of engineering! Since a young age *Hugo* enjoyed to disassemble and assemble mechanical toys - as he aged, this eventually led him to lend a hand and help replacing small parts on his father's car, and later allowed him to do regular maintenance work on his first car (_that he still has to this day!_). 

However, this interest in mechanical engineering initially emerged out of necessity rather than as a true hobby—until motorcycles entered his life. From that point on, it evolved into a genuine passion, leading him to perform complete motorcycle maintenance and troubleshoot mechanical issues on his own bikes as well as those of friends.

_As a side note, *Hugo* also organizes and leads group motorcycle tours and weekend trips._

## An Avid Writer

_Hugo is also an avid writer,_ and with the advent of Artificial Intelligence, his writings took an exponential upturn.

> "*Writing is both my voice and my tool to be heard: a way to express ideas, question assumptions, and invite others to look at familiar topics from a different perspective.*  
> *Through writing, I organize and “clean” my mind of opinions and thought processes, while simultaneously challenging established norms and encouraging deeper reflection rather than passive acceptance."*  
> ~ *Hugo V Monteiro*
