## Beyond Technology

Beyond technology, *Hugo*'s curiosity naturally extends to virtually every area of society — engineering, social dynamics, economics, finance, investing, business, history, politics, science, art, music, and, in general, any domain shaped by human thought and behavior.

## The Musician

Music has always been a constant in *Hugo*'s life. From having classical training in his early years in a renown music academy, to learning electric guitar on his own in his teens, which eventually led to him joining a band with a record contract and a booking agency, recording music albums and touring across Portugal and Europe.




This unusual hobby further strengthened his skills in organization, planning and management.

## D.I.Y. - Do It Yourself

Since *Hugo* has a strong drive to understand how and why things work and explore things from the inside out, this led him to learn how things are done, which means that very rarely he needs to hire someone to do most common things other people need - be it plumbing, painting, woodwork (ex: closets, music racks...),  fixing broken things (ex: dishwashers, furnaces, small appliances...), interior room decorations (indoor ceilings, home offices...), he even gave a hand helping build two family houses at a certain point in time...this means that sometimes friends and family ask him for help to fix things.

## Mechanics & Motorcycles

 Mechanics, the pinnacle of engineering! Since an young age *Hugo* liked to dismantle and assemble toys - this eventually led him to lend a hand and help replacing small parts on his father's car, and later taking care of small regular maintenance work on his first car (that he still has to this day!). 

But, this interest for mechanical engineering was only out of necessity, not yet pursuit as a hobby yet...until motorcycles came to his existence - it was then that it became an hobby, doing full motorcycle maintenance and fixing problems for his and friends motorcycles.

On a side note, *Hugo* also creates and manages group motorcycle tours and weekend trips.

## An Avid Writer

_Hugo is also an avid writer._

Writing is both his voice and his tool: a way to express ideas, question assumptions, and invite others to look at familiar topics from a different perspective. Through writing, he organizes and “cleans” his mind of opinions and thought processes, while simultaneously challenging established norms and encouraging deeper reflection rather than passive acceptance.
