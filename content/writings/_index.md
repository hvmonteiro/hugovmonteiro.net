>"_Writing is both my voice and my tool to be heard: a way to express ideas, question assumptions, and invite others to look at familiar topics from a different perspective._  
_Through writing, I organize and “clean” my mind of opinions and thought processes, while simultaneously challenging established norms and encouraging deeper reflection rather than passive acceptance."_
