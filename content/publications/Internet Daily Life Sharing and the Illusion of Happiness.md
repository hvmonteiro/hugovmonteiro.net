**Internet Daily Life Sharing and the Illusion of Happiness**  
  
The societal trend of constantly sharing daily life moments, vacations, and similar content is, in many cases, a self-created illusion—an attempt by individuals to convince themselves that they are happy with their lives, and that today’s societal structure is meaningful and fulfilling, even when it may not be.
