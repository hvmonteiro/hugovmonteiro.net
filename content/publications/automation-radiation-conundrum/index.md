## Why Wired Home Automation Still Makes the Most Sense

In today’s world, many people are excited about "smart homes" full of wireless devices controlled by smartphones and cloud apps. But they bring with them some hidden problems, especially when it comes to long-term reliability, radiation exposure, cybersecurity, and compatibility with older homes.

These wireless devices use WiFi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, Z-Wave, or other similar radio technologies, and are promoted as revolutionary solutions. But behind the marketing, many of these wireless systems are just modern-looking remote controls, not true automation with major risks involved. 

Wired installations in most situations still offer the smartest, most durable solution. But even wired systems are not perfect in every scenario.

## Remote Control Is Not Automation

Let’s start with a basic misunderstanding. Many so-called smart devices let you turn on lights or heating from your phone. But this is not real automation, it’s just remote control.

We've had remote control for over a century - a basic wall switch near a door is a perfect example. You walk into a room and flip the switch. This action is instant, reliable, and requires no internet or battery.

True automation means the system works *on its own*, reacting to your presence or needs without input. For example, if you walk into a hallway at night, lights should automatically turn on based on motion sensors and time of day. 

This kind of intelligence is only practical and reliable when built into a permanent, local system that doesn’t depends on the cloud or WiFi.

## Wired vs Wireless: The Core Differences

### 1. **Reliability and Longevity**

Wireless systems rely on radio frequencies and battery-powered devices. These can suffer from signal drops, interference from other electronics, and battery failures. WiFi protocols also change over time—older versions like 802.11b/g are already obsolete. What happens in 15 years when your smart device no longer supports the current WiFi standard as it happened with many other protocols in the past?

By contrast, Ethernet and other wired communication technologies have proven stable and compatible for decades. Even modern devices can communicate using protocols from the 1980s. When designing infrastructure in a house that should last 100 years, permanent and predictable systems like wired automation are the smarter choice.

### 2. **Cybersecurity**

Wireless systems often require an internet connection to function. This opens many security problems like cyber-attacks, and devices that rely on third-party cloud services can stop working if the company goes bankrupt or ends support. And to make matters worse, cloud-connected devices often collect user data and create privacy concerns, besides the problem that you are having the privacy of your home connected to an external system that you don’t have control off.

Hackers easily target wireless home systems, and since these devices usually control important parts of your home (lights, alarms, doors), the risk becomes serious.

Wired systems, especially those designed to run locally and offline, are much harder to attack. There are fewer access points for hackers to physically tap in, and no need for your home to send data to an external server to work as intended.

## Radiation in the Wireless World

And this brings us to one of the more serious problems with wireless technologies, the **radiation conundrum**.

Wireless systems operate through radio signals, which means they constantly emit low-level electromagnetic radiation—even when in standby mode and not actively transmitting. While the scientific community continues to debate the full extent of the health effects of this radiation, one undeniable fact remains: humanity has never been exposed to this level of electromagnetic radiation before.

From high-power sources like cell towers using GSM/UMTS, 3G, 4G, 5G, and the upcoming 6G technologies, to medium-level sources such as Wi-Fi networks operating on 2.4GHz and 5GHz frequencies (often with multiple antennas to extend range and performance), and even to more localized but concentrated sources like Bluetooth and other near-field wireless technologies—we are surrounded by continuous and layered radiation like never before.

More and more individuals are reporting sensitivity to this radiation, leading some to take proactive steps to reduce their exposure, especially in more personal spaces like bedrooms and children's rooms.

The situation becomes even more critical in densely populated environments like apartment buildings or condominiums, where nearly every unit has at least one wireless router. If you simply open your smartphone and scan for Wi-Fi networks, the sheer number of active signals in your vicinity can be eye-opening—and highlights just how saturated our living spaces have become with electromagnetic emissions.

## Using Wired Systems to Avoid Radiation

Wired systems avoid this problem completely. Signals travel through cables, not the air, which makes them not only more secure and reliable, but also free from unnecessary electromagnetic pollution.

> Would you replace your light switch with a device that constantly emits radiation?
> 

Think of it this way: Would you replace your light switch with a device that constantly emits radiation, needs an app to work, might stop working if the server goes down, and can be hacked? Probably not. But that’s exactly what many wireless solutions offer.
This is a clear example of what can be called a "gimmick to make a buck"—a manufactured solution to a non-existent problem, driven by heavy marketing and persuasion rather than genuine need or logic.

Eventually, as with all trends, people will begin to realize the importance of practicality and common sense. They’ll move away from flashy, unnecessary tech and shift focus toward developing meaningful, sustainable solutions that address real-world problems—not just temporary products created for quick profits.

## The Challenge of Wiring Old Homes

However, even wired systems have limits—especially in older houses.

Many wired automation systems use **power line communication protocols**, meaning the signal travels through the existing electrical wires in the house. But in many older homes, the electrical installation might be outdated, poorly maintained or installed in such a way that doesn’t allow powerline protocols to transverse physical electrical sections. This can cause interference, unreliable communication, or total failure of the underlaying communication system.

In such cases, a new wired installation might be necessary, which can be expensive and invasive. This makes wireless systems more attractive in short-term or retrofit projects—but they still come with the same long-term downsides.

## The Sensible Approach: Wired First, Wireless Only If Necessary

If you are building a new house or doing a major renovation, **wired automation is the best choice**. It offers:

- Long-term compatibility
- Better cybersecurity
- Zero radiation exposure
- Reliable performance
- Support for automation

In older homes or rental properties, wireless systems may sometimes be the only practical choice - but they should be used with care. Opt for devices that offer local control, minimize reliance on cloud services, and stay aware of the potential cybersecurity risks and radiation exposure that come with many off-the-shelf solutions.

Consider exploring open-source alternatives, which often prioritize privacy and transparency. DIY (Do It Yourself) can also be a great approach—there are many detailed step-by-step guides available that can walk you through setting up a complete system tailored to your home, needs, and values.

## Conclusion

The current automation trend is part of a bigger problem: the push toward "smart" technology that is actually fragile, short-lived, and over-complicated. Wireless systems might seem modern, but they often sacrifice reliability, privacy, and more importantly health for temporary convenience.

> Home automation should be **safe, stable, invisible, and helpful**.
> 

Home automation should be safe, stable, invisible, and helpful. It should work in the background, without asking for attention or maintenance. It should respect the fact that your home is not a smartphone and instead a long-term space that deserves long-term thinking.

Wired systems are not just better - they are common sense. And in a world where everything seems to go wireless, choosing wires might be the smartest decision of all, for you, your family, and for the future.
