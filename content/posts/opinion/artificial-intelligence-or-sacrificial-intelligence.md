By now, everyone has heard about **Artificial Intelligence** (AI) and the technological transformations it will bring, more so regarding the high probability of replacing people and eliminate some jobs. Will Artificial Intelligence replace people?
But this is not the right question we should be asking.
The real question that everyone should be asking is not “*Will AI replace people?*”, but rather “*Will managers replace people with Artificial Intelligence?*”
That presents the problem as it really is, and takes it to the people responsible to manage the situation and puts that decision responsibility in their hands.

This effectively shifts the focus from the technological aspect to the human dimension, accurately capturing the core issue at hand, and places the responsibility for managing the situation in the hands of those really accountable.
The right question makes those accountable urged to make decisions that prioritise the collective good.
And therein lies the focal point where society should direct its attention and questions.
Similarly to past technological advancements, the core issue with Artificial Intelligence isn't solely about the technology itself, but it highlights again the potential risks and consequences associated with the pursuit of advanced intelligence at the expense of other values, such as ethics, human well-being, or environmental sustainability, and presents the issue as a warning against blindly prioritizing intelligence enhancement without considering broader ethical or existential implications.
So, let us demand ethical and responsible decisions from those in positions of power, so that this doesn’t landslide from "***Artificial Intelligence***" to "***Sacrificial Intelligence***".
